# arctic-us
Two ideas: (1) use a map of the United States to show the area of Arctic sea ice. As the ice melts, 
we show states fading out to show the extent of the damage or (2) we show a circle of destruction 
around the users location which shows landmarks being destroyed over time. I prefer idea (2) so I'm
going to go ahead and start working on that.
